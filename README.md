Built for the Software Engineering Super League (SESL) using data obtained from CoolClimate project created by UC Berkley Copyright Â© 2014, Regents of the University of California, University of California, Berkeley. All rights reserved.

Prompt: Time is ticking and it's essential that we address the causes of global warming. Fast. And as they say: you can't manage what you don't measure. For this challenge, we need you to help a user calculate their carbon footprint. Build a web app that asks a user for their habits (food, travel, work, etc.), calculates their carbon footprint and then suggests how the user could reduce it.
